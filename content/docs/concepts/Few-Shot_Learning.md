## Core Idea
Few-shot learning is a technique where a model is trained to perform a task with very few examples, making it adaptable with minimal data.

## Explanation
Few-shot learning allows AI models to generalize tasks by learning from a limited number of examples, such as one or a few demonstrations. This method is especially useful for adapting large pre-trained models to specific tasks without extensive fine-tuning. Few-shot learning is common in language models, where it enables the model to complete tasks by showing it just a handful of examples.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Text Classification** – Categorizing text based on limited labeled examples, useful for new topics or domains.
- **Customer Support** – Adapts models to address new types of questions with only a few sample queries.
- **Language Translation** – Translating phrases in less common languages or dialects with minimal training data.
