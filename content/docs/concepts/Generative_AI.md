## Core Idea
Generative AI refers to systems that create new content, such as text, images, or music, by learning from existing data.

## Explanation
Generative AI models are trained to produce new content by learning patterns in large datasets. Unlike other AI, which focuses on classification or identification, generative AI emphasizes creation. It includes models like GANs (for images) and large language models (for text), which generate media across various formats.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Text Generation** – Produces responses or stories, commonly used in chatbots or content creation.
- **Image Synthesis** – Creates realistic images, such as for artwork or product design.
- **Music Composition** – Generates music tracks based on learned musical styles and structures.
