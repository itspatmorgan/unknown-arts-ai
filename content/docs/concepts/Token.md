## Core Idea
A token is a small piece of text, such as a word, subword, or character, that language models use as the building blocks for generating language.

## Explanation
Tokens are the individual units that make up language for a model. Depending on the language model, tokens can be whole words, parts of words, or even single characters. By breaking text into tokens, models can understand and generate language more effectively, processing each token to produce coherent text.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Text Generation** – Uses tokens to create responses, sentences, and paragraphs in natural language processing.
- **Machine Translation** – Translates text by processing tokens to understand sentence structure and meaning.
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Analyzes each token’s sentiment contribution for accurate sentiment scoring.
