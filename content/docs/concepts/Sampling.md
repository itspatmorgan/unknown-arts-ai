## Core Idea
Sampling is a method of selecting the next word in text generation based on probability, adding randomness to the output.

## Explanation
Sampling is a decoding technique where the model chooses the next token based on a probability distribution, rather than always selecting the highest probability option. This introduces variation in responses, useful for creative applications. Common sampling methods include **top-k sampling** (selects from the k most likely tokens) and **nucleus (top-p) sampling** (chooses tokens until a cumulative probability threshold is reached).

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Creative Writing** – Generates unique responses, such as story writing or poetry.
- **Conversational AI** – Adds diversity to chatbot responses for a more natural feel.
- **Game Dialogue Generation** – Randomized responses to enhance immersion and realism.
