## Core Idea
Machine Learning (ML) is a method of training AI systems to learn from data, improving their performance on specific tasks without explicit programming.

## Explanation
Machine Learning is a branch of AI where models are trained on data to identify patterns, make predictions, or categorize information. ML algorithms, from linear regression to neural networks, allow AI applications to improve with experience, adapting to new data over time.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Spam Detection** – Identifies spam emails based on patterns learned from data.
- **Customer Segmentation** – Groups customers in marketing based on purchasing patterns.
- **Predictive Maintenance** – Predicts equipment failures in industries like manufacturing to avoid downtime.
