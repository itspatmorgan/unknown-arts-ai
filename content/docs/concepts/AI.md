## Core Idea
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the field of creating machines or software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, like understanding language, recognizing images, or making decisions.

## Explanation
AI refers to the development of systems capable of tasks that usually require human intelligence. These systems range from simple algorithms to advanced neural networks that can process large amounts of data. AI powers technologies like image recognition, voice assistants, and recommendation systems, impacting healthcare, finance, entertainment, and more.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Enables systems to understand and generate human language, such as in chatbots and language translation.
- **Computer Vision** – Allows AI to interpret and analyze images or videos, used in areas like autonomous driving.
- **Recommendation Engines** – Powers content suggestions in streaming services, online stores, and social media platforms.
