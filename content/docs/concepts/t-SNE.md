## Core Idea
t-SNE is a technique for visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing it to two or three dimensions.

## Explanation
t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) is a machine learning algorithm that reduces complex, high-dimensional data into two or three dimensions, making it easier to visualize relationships and clusters. Commonly used with embeddings and other dense vectors, t-SNE helps researchers interpret and analyze how data points, such as word embeddings, are distributed.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Word Embedding Visualization** – Shows relationships and clusters of words in vector space.
- **Image Data Analysis** – Visualizes image features, aiding in clustering and pattern discovery.
- **Customer Segmentation** – Reduces customer data to interpretable dimensions for identifying distinct groups.
