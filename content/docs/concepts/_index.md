## AI Concept Glossary

This glossary is designed to be a quick reference for foundational concepts in AI, with a focus on techniques for working with large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. Whether youâ€™re new to AI or looking to deepen your understanding of specific terms, this glossary will help clarify the basics and highlight connections within the field.

Each entry provides essential information in layman's terms, along with links to related people, resources, and concepts for further exploration.

## Concepts

### [AI](AI)
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the field of creating machines or software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, like understanding language, recognizing images, or making decisions.

### [Machine Learning](Machine_Learning)
Machine Learning (ML) is a method of training AI systems to learn from data, improving their performance on specific tasks without explicit programming.

### [Deep Learning](Deep_Learning)
Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze complex patterns in large datasets.

### [Generative AI](Generative_AI)
Generative AI refers to systems that create new content, such as text, images, or music, by learning from existing data.

### [LLM (Large Language Model)](LLM_Large_Language_Model)
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language.

### [Embedding](Embedding)
An embedding is a way of representing words or concepts as numbers to capture their meaning and relationships in a model.

### [Token](Token)
A token is a small piece of text, such as a word, subword, or character, that language models use as the building blocks for generating language.

### [Dense vs. Sparse Vectors](Dense_Sparse_Vectors)
Dense and sparse vectors are two types of data representations, with dense vectors having mostly non-zero values and sparse vectors having mostly zero values.

### [Prompt](Prompt)
A prompt is an instruction given to a model, guiding it to generate specific types of responses.

### [Sampling](Sampling)
Sampling is a method of selecting the next word in text generation based on probability, adding randomness to the output.

### [Fine-Tuning](Fine-Tuning)
Fine-tuning is a method of further training an AI model on specific tasks or domains to improve its performance in targeted applications.

### [Few-Shot Learning](Few-Shot_Learning)
Few-shot learning is a technique where a model is trained to perform a task with very few examples, making it adaptable with minimal data.

### [Meta-Prompting](Meta-Prompting)
Meta-prompting is a strategy that uses prompts to shape or refine how other prompts are formulated, guiding AI output by prompting at a meta level.

### [Decoding](Decoding)
Decoding is how AI picks words to build its response, influencing how natural or accurate the output sounds.

### [t-SNE](t-SNE)
t-SNE is a technique for visualizing high-dimensional data by reducing it to two or three dimensions.
