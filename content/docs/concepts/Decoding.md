## Core Idea
Decoding is how AI picks words to build its response, influencing how natural or accurate the output sounds.

## Explanation
Decoding is the process by which a language model chooses each word (or “token”) in its response. Different methods impact the final output’s clarity, relevance, and creativity. Common strategies include:
- **Greedy Decoding**: Chooses the highest-probability word at each step, making responses clear but potentially repetitive.
- **Beam Search**: Examines multiple paths to create balanced, coherent responses—good for translations and summaries.
- **Sampling**: Selects words more randomly, adding variety and creativity. Variants include **top-k sampling** (chooses from a limited set) and **nucleus (top-p) sampling** (adjusts based on overall probability).

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Creative Writing** – Top-k and Top-p sampling methods add originality in AI-written stories and poetry.
- **Conversational Agents** – Greedy decoding keeps answers accurate in customer service.
- **Translation** – Beam search preserves sentence flow and meaning in language translations.
