## Core Idea
Cosine Similarity measures how similar two sets of information are by calculating the angle between their vector representations.

## Explanation
Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two non-zero vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. In natural language processing, it’s often used to determine the “distance” or similarity between vector representations (embeddings) of words, sentences, or documents. A cosine similarity of 1 indicates identical directionality, 0 implies no similarity, and -1 indicates opposite directionality. Unlike Euclidean distance, cosine similarity considers only the orientation, making it especially useful for comparing text data in high-dimensional spaces.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Document Similarity** – Useful in recommendation engines for finding articles or documents similar in content.
- **Intent Recognition** – Helps identify similarity between user queries and intents in chatbots and virtual assistants.
- **Search and Information Retrieval** – Enhances search results by ranking documents based on similarity to the query vector.
