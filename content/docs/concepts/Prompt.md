## Core Idea
A prompt is an instruction given to a model, guiding it to generate specific types of responses.

## Explanation
In language models, a prompt serves as a guiding input that frames the response generated by the model. Prompts can be simple questions or complex instructions, often structured to encourage specific tones, formats, or types of information in the output. Prompting is foundational to AI, as it defines how models interact with user requests and respond based on the instructions provided.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Question Answering** – Prompts guide the model to retrieve or generate answers based on user input.
- **Content Generation** – Frames specific topics or styles for text output, like articles or social media posts.
- **Data Analysis** – Prompts the model to analyze or summarize information, often within large datasets.
