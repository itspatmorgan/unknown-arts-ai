## Core Idea
Fine-tuning is a method of further training an AI model on specific tasks or domains to improve its performance in targeted applications.

## Explanation
Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and refining it with additional data specific to a certain task or domain. This technique adapts general-purpose models to perform better in specialized contexts, such as adjusting a language model for legal, medical, or customer support applications. Fine-tuning is less resource-intensive than training from scratch, as it builds on an already trained model.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Fine-tuning a language model with customer feedback data to accurately gauge sentiment in reviews.
- **Medical Diagnosis** – Adapting a model with medical literature to assist in diagnostic tools.
- **Legal Document Review** – Training a model on legal documents to support contract analysis.
