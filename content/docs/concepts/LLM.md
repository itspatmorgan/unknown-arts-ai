## Core Idea
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language.

## Explanation
LLMs are advanced language models trained on vast amounts of text to generate coherent responses and perform language-related tasks. They utilize deep learning, particularly transformer architectures, and are designed to predict the next word in a sequence, enabling applications from chatbots to language translation. GPT-3 and BERT are popular examples of LLMs.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Text Summarization** – Condenses long texts into key points for easier understanding.
- **Question Answering** – Provides answers to user queries in customer support and search engines.
- **Language Translation** – Translates text between languages while preserving context.
