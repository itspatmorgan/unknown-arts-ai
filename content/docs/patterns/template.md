## Purpose
The Template pattern provides a consistent structure for AI responses, ensuring outputs follow a set format. This is ideal for tasks requiring uniformity, such as reports or email templates.

## How it Works
Define a layout or format, and the AI will fill in the content accordingly. Templates help maintain consistency across different outputs by adhering to a pre-determined structure.

## Example
- **Prompt**: “Use this template to write an email: [Greeting], [Introduction], [Main Message], [Closing].”
- **AI Response**: Follows the template, filling each section with relevant content.

## How to Use
1. **Create a Layout**: Specify the sections and their intended content.
2. **Use Placeholders**: Define placeholders for dynamic content.
3. **Adjust for Different Outputs**: Modify the template based on specific needs, like email vs. report.

## Practical Tips
- **Define Clear Sections**: Clearly specify each part of the template to avoid ambiguity.
- **Use Common Formats**: For tasks like emails or reports, standard formats enhance readability.
- **Incorporate Style Guides**: Add stylistic elements to align with brand guidelines or preferences.

## Watch Outs
- **Overly Rigid Structure**: Too much rigidity can make outputs feel repetitive or formulaic.
- **Mismatch with Content**: Ensure that the template matches the content type to avoid awkward formatting.
- **Template Creep**: Avoid creating too many templates, which can complicate the workflow.

## Creative Use Cases
- **For Writers**: Create templates for different types of content, such as blog posts or newsletters.
- **For Designers**: Develop layout templates for presentations or documents.
