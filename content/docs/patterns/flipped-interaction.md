title: 'Flipped Interaction'
---

## Purpose
The Flipped Interaction pattern allows the AI to take the lead in a conversation by asking questions and steering the dialogue. This is useful for exploring topics in an open-ended way or when trying to source insights from yourself.

## How it Works
Instead of the user asking questions, the AI takes the initiative, posing questions to explore different facets of a topic. This can simulate a coaching session or an exploratory dialogue.

## Example
- **Prompt**: “Ask me questions to help me understand my motivations for this project.”
- **AI Response**: Asks questions aimed at uncovering deeper motivations, such as, “What do you hope to achieve by completing this project?”

## How to Use
1. **Define the Topic**: Specify the area or topic you want to explore.
2. **Prompt for AI-Led Questions**: Ask the AI to lead by questioning, focusing on uncovering insights.
3. **Engage in the Dialogue**: Respond to the AI’s questions, allowing it to steer the conversation further.

## Practical Tips
- **Use for Self-Reflection**: Ideal for personal development or self-reflection exercises.
- **Prompt for Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage the AI to ask open-ended questions that provoke thought.
- **Combine with Personas**: Assign a persona to the AI, like a coach or advisor, to tailor the questioning style.
- **Specify how much it should follow up**: Give the AI some sense of how deeply it should probe into complex issues before continuing on.

## Watch Outs
- **Lack of Focus**: The AI’s questions may veer off-topic, so guide it back if needed.
- **Superficial Questions**: Some questions might be shallow or generic; feel free to redirect for depth.
- **Limited Depth**: The AI may not probe deeply enough on complex issues without prompting.

## Creative Use Cases
- **For Coaching**: Use to simulate a coaching session with AI-led questions.
- **For Writers**: Engage the AI in exploring new angles on a topic.

## Related Patterns
- **[Persona](../persona)**: Use with Persona to give the AI a specific role, like a therapist or teacher, during interaction.
- **[Context Manager](../context-manager)**: Provide context for the AI to frame its questions appropriately.
