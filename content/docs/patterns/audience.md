title: 'Audience'
---

## Purpose
The Persona pattern allows you to assign a specific role or voice to the AI, ensuring that responses maintain a consistent tone and perspective.

## How it Works
By specifying a particular audience you're creating for, you guide the AI toward generating output that is more specific and appropriate.

## Example
- **Prompt**:
- **AI Response**:

## How to Use
1. **Define the Audience**: Specify the audience in as much detail as possible.
2. **Contextualize Responses**: Use the audience in prompts to drive AI output.
3. **Refine and Repeat**: Adjust based on the AIâ€™s responses to improve accuracy.

## Practical Tips
- **Be Descriptive**: The more detailed the persona, the more accurate the AI's response.
- **Experiment with Styles**: Try different audiences to explore varied tones or viewpoints.

## Watch Outs
- **Risk of Stereotyping**: Be mindful not to overly stereotype audiences, which can lead to inauthentic outputs.
- **Context Drift**: Over time, the AI might deviate from the audience, especially in long interactions.

## Creative Use Cases
- **For Writers**: Use audiences to experiment with getting the tone just right.
- **For Marketers**: Develop a brand voice and ensure consistent messaging across content.
