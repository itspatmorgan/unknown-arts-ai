title: 'Using Model Introspection to Generate Quick-Start Guides for Marketplace GPTs'
displayUpdatedDate: true
---

## Background
The GPT Store enables anyone to create and share specialized AI assistants. However, even the most popular GPTs like Siqi Chen's Universal Primer (1M+ conversations) provide minimal guidance on how to use them effectively.

## The Challenge
When using marketplace GPTs, users face two key issues:
1. **Limited Context**: GPT descriptions don't fully convey their capabilities or ideal use cases
2. **Unclear Interaction Patterns**: The standard chat interface doesn't guide users toward effective usage

## Experiment
I explored whether carefully crafted prompts could help extract and present useful guidance for GPT users, without requiring access to the underlying system prompts.

### Approach
I developed two types of prompts:

1. **Technical Diagnostic Prompt**
   - Designed to help understand a GPT's core mechanics and capabilities
   - Focused on surfacing interaction patterns and specialized features
   - Used primarily for analysis and research

2. **User Guide Generator**
   - Converts technical insights into practical user guidance
   - Creates standardized, easy-to-follow quick-start guides
   - Focuses on immediate user value

### Implementation
I tested these prompts with Universal Primer GPT as an initial case study. This helped validate that:
- Marketplace GPTs could effectively introspect on their own capabilities
- The resulting insights could be transformed into useful guidance
- The approach could work without exposing proprietary prompt engineering

## Detailed Solutions
The experiment produced two key artifacts:

### 1. GPT Introspection Diagnostic Prompt
#### Purpose
I created this diagnostic prompt to help power users and developers better understand the underlying mechanics of custom GPTs. While the system prompt can't be exposed publicly (which is important for monetization), this diagnostic approach helps reveal: 
- Core capabilities and design principles 
- Optimal interaction patterns 
- Key limitations and strengths

This technical analysis then informs the creation of user-facing documentation and guides.

#### Prompt
{{% include-resource "content/docs/projects/gpt-user-guides/diagnostic-prompt.md" %}}

#### Example Response
When tested with Universal Primer GPT, this diagnostic prompt revealed detailed insights about its teaching methodology, interaction style, and specialized capabilities. 

The full response demonstrates how effectively a GPT can articulate its own design principles and usage patterns:

### 2. Quick-Start User Guide Prompt

#### Purpose
Building on insights from the diagnostic phase, I developed this prompt to generate standardized quick-start guides for everyday users. 

The goals were to: 
- Transform technical insights into practical guidance 
- Create consistent documentation across different GPTs 
- Help users quickly understand how to get the best results 
- Provide concrete examples of effective interactions 

The prompt intentionally follows a structured format that could be automated across the GPT marketplace.
#### Prompt
{{% include-resource "content/docs/projects/gpt-user-guides/user-guide-prompt.md" %}}

#### Example Response
The resulting guide demonstrates how technical understanding can be transformed into clear, actionable guidance for users. Note how it maintains Universal Primer's teaching-focused identity while providing practical interaction tips:

## Benefits
This experimental approach shows promise for:
- Making GPTs more accessible to new users
- Providing consistent, helpful guidance across different GPTs
- Protecting proprietary aspects while surfacing key capabilities

## Limitations & Considerations
- Initial experiment and testing limited to one GPT; broader validation would be valuable 
- Some guidance overlaps with general ChatGPT best practices 
- Visual integration into the GPT Store UI would be a natural next step

## Future Potential
While this experiment focused on testing a narrow selection of GPTs, the approach could be expanded to:
- Generate guides automatically for marketplace GPTs 
- Integrate guides directly into the GPT Store interface 
- Create interactive onboarding experiences based on guide content
- Help users discover and effectively use specialized GPTs
