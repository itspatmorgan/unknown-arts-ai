- **Community:** Walk and talk around silver lake reservoir
- **Content**: Went through all my YouTube playlists and cleaned them up to make it easier to find AI learning, AI commentary, Creativity, etc...
- **Coding:** 
	- Spent a couple of hours trying to resolve bugs coming from Jekyll and the theme I picked.
	- It became clear that that solution wasn't going to give me what I wanted, so I bailed on that direction. Started investigating another option, Hugo.
	- Picked a Hugo theme, and outlined steps to migrate, to pick up tomorrow.
