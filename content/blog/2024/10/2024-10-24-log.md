- __Writing__
	- Drafted `The Dispatch` article for this Sunday. 
		- Identified a couple of resources I want to add to the site before publication.
	- Drafted `The Muse` article for next Wednesday.
		- Used my custom GPT prompt to guide a 45 minute conversation with the model. 
			- I picked the topic and it interviewed me while I took a walk around the neighborhood.
		- I had the model synthesize my spoken ideas into a couple of article ideas.
		- I picked one that seemed most aligned with next week's theme.
		- I had the model write an outline and then a rough draft.
		- I saved the draft and started thinking about how I'll edit it.
