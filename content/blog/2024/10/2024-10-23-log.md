- __Learning__
	- Prompt engineering course: Module 4 exercises
		- Created a few-shot prompt: _Designing a personalized fitness plan for a busy executive_
			- Tried writing this from scratch without model input. Performed okay. Still better to collaborate on prompt design with the model.
		- Created a multi-step prompt: _Organizing a multi-leg international trip for a family of four_
			- An interesting result from this one: I instructed the model to emulate a travel agent, do an initial consultation with me to gather info and then go about its work planning the trip. After gathering the info, the model replied that it would get back to me in 2-3 business days, emulating the kind of workflow it expected from that persona (despite its ability to execute the task immediately). An interesting thing to note for future prompt refinement: the balance between leaning into a persona vs. maintaining the model's awareness of its machine powers.
- __Ideation__
	- Explored a couple of concepts in more depth:
		- Meta-prompting
		- Recursion as a property of machine growth vs. human growth
		- "How might we..." as a prompting pattern
- __Life__
	- Shorter work day today as I was attended pre-wedding festivities.
