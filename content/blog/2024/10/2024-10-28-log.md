    - Tested prompt variations by interviewing myself on topics:
        - Fleeting queries vs. enduring queries
        - AI's impact on the future of work
- __Coding__
    - Using ChatGPT, created a Python script that can retrieve the captions from a YouTube video, process it to extract the text, and summarize it.
- __Learning__

    - Borrowed Sapiens from the library to read more from Yuval Noah Harari. Saved his new book "Nexus" to read soon.
