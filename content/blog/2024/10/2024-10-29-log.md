- __Coding__
    - Created a Python script to convert the 150+ HTML files in my Substack account into markdown. 
    - The idea is to gather and process my catalog so that I can a) have my full archive in markdown 2) combine all my articles as a knowledge base to use in a Claude Project to assist with writing.
- __Management__
    - Substantial rework of my tasks from Apple Reminders into Notion
    - Restructured my Notion to capture content focused on AI and archived old stuff
- __Learning__
    - Began listening to *Sapiens*
