## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey, I'm [Patrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itspatmorgan/)!

I'm a creative technologist and the writer behind [Unknown Arts](https://www.unknownarts.co) on Substack.

With *Unknown Arts*, I explore how creativity flows through new technology and help creative professionals embrace the power of both cutting-edge tools and timeless wisdom.

This project is a way for me to investigate practical uses of AI and share them with the community. I want to elevate our collective understanding of these transformative technologies and support creatives everywhere in our shared quest to create meaningful work that positively impacts the world.

I've spent over a decade designing digital products and pushing the boundaries of innovation for top brands, but my real passion lies in helping creative people harness new technology to unlock their best work. Whether you're a tech professional, artist, or entrepreneur, *Unknown Arts* is designed to help you!

Now, let's get building!
