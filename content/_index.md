## üìñ Overview

Welcome to the companion website for the [Unknown Arts newsletter](https://www.unknownarts.co)! 

This site documents my exploration into the world of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on learning, experimentation, and sharing insights with the community.

I'm actively working on this project, so expect a variety of content, including:

- Markdown files summarizing key concepts and findings (now)
- Links to useful resources (now)
- My daily blog of learning and experimentation (now)
- Jupyter Notebooks with tutorials, code examples, and projects (future)
- Scripts and other Python files for more focused coding exercises (future)

This will evolve over time.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hey, I'm Patrick!

I'm the creator of this repo and the writer behind [Unknown Arts](https://www.unknownarts.co) on Substack.

Through *Unknown Arts*, I help creative professionals embrace the power of cutting-edge tools and timeless wisdom to find their way to creative success and fulfillment.

I‚Äôve spent over a decade designing digital products and pushing the boundaries of innovation for top brands, but my real passion lies in exploring how creative people can harness technology to unlock their best work. Whether you‚Äôre an artist, entrepreneur, or technologist, this space is designed to help you tap into the creative power that comes from both technology and timeless craft traditions.

This project is a way for me to explore practical uses of AI and share them with other creative professionals. I want to elevate our collective understanding of these transformative technologies and support creatives in our shared quest to create meaningful work that positively impacts the world.

Now, let‚Äôs get building!
