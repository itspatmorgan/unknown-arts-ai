## Core Idea
Meta-prompting is a strategy that uses prompts to shape or refine how other prompts are formulated, guiding AI output by prompting at a meta level.

## Explanation
Meta-prompting involves crafting a prompt that indirectly influences a model’s response strategy by shaping subsequent prompts. For example, a meta-prompt might instruct the model to "explain complex ideas in simple terms" or "approach the question as a knowledgeable friend." This technique can improve the relevance and quality of responses, especially in complex tasks requiring nuanced output.

## Applications/Use Cases
- **Content Summarization** – Guides the model to produce summaries by embedding clarity instructions in the prompt.
- **Education and Tutoring** – Uses meta-prompts to adjust responses to different comprehension levels.
- **Customer Service** – Helps models maintain a helpful tone or adapt explanations to customer knowledge levels.
