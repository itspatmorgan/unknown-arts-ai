title: 'Fact Check List'
---

## Purpose
The Fact Check List pattern ensures accuracy by prompting the AI to identify and list key facts for verification. This is especially useful for research, content creation, and fact-heavy tasks.

## How it Works
After generating a response, the AI lists essential facts or data points that require verification. You can then cross-reference these with credible sources.

## Example
- **Prompt**: “Summarize the key facts in this report for verification.”
- **AI Response**: Lists important details, like dates, figures, and names, for fact-checking.

## How to Use
1. **Request a Summary of Facts**: Ask the AI to extract key facts from its response.
2. **Cross-Reference**: Verify each listed fact against reliable sources.
3. **Provide Corrections**: If any facts are incorrect, guide the AI to refine its responses.

## Practical Tips
- **Use for Research**: Ideal for ensuring accuracy in research summaries or reports.
- **Focus on Important Facts**: Specify which facts are crucial to the context for more targeted verification.
- **Combine with Other Patterns**: Use with Reflection to further refine fact-checking.

## Watch Outs
- **Missed Facts**: The AI might overlook minor but relevant details, so conduct a thorough review.
- **Accuracy Limitations**: Remember, AI-generated facts should always be verified against authoritative sources.
- **Over-Reliance**: Fact Check List doesn’t replace thorough research; it’s an aid, not a substitute.

## Creative Use Cases
- **For Journalists**: Use for quick fact checks in news summaries.
- **For Educators**: Summarize key facts in lesson plans or study guides.
