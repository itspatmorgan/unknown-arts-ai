Hey, I'm Patrick! 👋

I'm the creator of this repo and the writer behind [Unknown Arts](https://www.unknownarts.co) on Substack. What’s my writing like? Imagine if Seth Godin and Derek Sivers had a design brainchild.

You can also find me on [X](https://x.com/itspatmorgan), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itspatmorgan/), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@itspatmorgan).

I’ve built a multidisciplinary career over more than a decade in tech:

- I designed UX for billion-dollar enterprise software startups
- I engineered software for a consumer finance behemoth
- And I crafted communication strategies for some of the world's top brands.

Design, engineering, and brand strategy — together, they form a powerful skill set that helps modern creators excel.

This project is a way for me to explore practical uses of AI and share them with other creative professionals. I want to elevate our collective understanding of these transformative technologies and support creatives in our shared quest to create meaningful work that positively impacts the world.

Now, let’s get building!
