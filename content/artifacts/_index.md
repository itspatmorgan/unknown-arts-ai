This section serves as a repository of artifacts from my ongoing AI experiments, featuring prompts, scripts, and resources developed while working with ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI models.

You'll find an evolving collection of tested prompts, code snippets, workflow templates, and generated assets - all documented with context and practical applications.

Think of this as both a living laboratory and a toolbox.
