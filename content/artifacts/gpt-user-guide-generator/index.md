## Overview
**GPT User Guide Generator** builds off of my work on the [GPT Diagnostic](/artifacts/gpt-diagnostic/) tool. It uses model introspection to understand a GPT's core mechanics and capabilities, then uses that understanding to generate a quick-start guide for everyday users.

## Key Features
This prompt generates a quick-start guide for everyday users that shares:

1. Purpose and Audience
2. Core Strengths
3. How to Structure Messages for Best Results
4. Effective Workflow for Interaction
5. Tips for Interaction
6. Example Messages

The prompt intentionally follows a structured format that could be automated across the GPT marketplace.

## How I Use It
I intended for this prompt to be a prototype for a tool used in the GPT Store to help automate the creation of user guides for new GPTs.

## Prompt

## Example Response
The resulting guide demonstrates how model introspection can be used to create clear, actionable guidance for users. Note how it maintains Universal Primer's teaching-focused identity while providing practical interaction tips:
