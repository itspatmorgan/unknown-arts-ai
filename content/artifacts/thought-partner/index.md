## Overview

**Thought Partner** is a prompt designed to facilitate idea exploration and insightful conversation. It emulates the style of thoughtful interviewers providing a semi-structured space for developing new ideas.

## Key Features

1. AI-driven thought partner
2. Semi-structured workflow for idea exploration
3. Post-conversation support including synthesis, main themes, and summary

## How I Use It

I use this prompt with ChatGPT to help me explore new ideas for essays. I generally start with a core idea, share it to begin the conversation, and then use the voice mode to ideate naturally out loud. This taps into my creative mind and allows me to explore the idea more improvisationally and authentically without judging or structuring my thoughts prematurely. Then, once I feel we've gone sufficiently deep, I ask it to synthesize the main points and summarize the conversation into an outline using my expressed language that I can use to write the essay.
