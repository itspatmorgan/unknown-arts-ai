## Overview

I designed this curriculum to support my own learning journey, curating a balanced exploration of AI's technical foundations and human implications. 

This journey weaves together three perspectives that complement each other:

- **Foundations**: Non-fiction works that ground us in the real implications of AI
- **Stories**: Fiction that helps us imagine possibilities and wrestle with future dilemmas
- **Visions**: Films that make these concepts tangible and emotionally resonant

Each element builds on the others, helping us develop a richer, overall understanding. The goal isn't mastery of every concept, but rather gaining new lenses through which to view AI's impact on our creative and professional lives.

Each week includes both core materials and an "Ambitious Explorer" section that offers additional guidance if you want to go deeper.
